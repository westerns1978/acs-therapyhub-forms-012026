# ACS TherapyHub: Gamification Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the gamification strategy for ACS TherapyHub, designed to increase engagement, motivation, and positive outcomes for both clients and therapists. By incorporating game-like mechanics, we can make the challenging process of court-mandated treatment more transparent and rewarding.

## 2. Goals

-   **For Clients:**
    -   Increase session attendance and program adherence.
    -   Provide a clear, visual sense of progress and accomplishment.
    -   Encourage proactive engagement with program requirements (e.g., support groups, DMV tasks).
    -   Reduce feelings of being overwhelmed by breaking down the program into smaller, achievable steps.
-   **For Therapists:**
    -   Improve data-driven insights into client engagement.
    -   Recognize and reward high performance and compliance management.
    -   Foster a sense of friendly competition and team morale.

## 3. Client Gamification Mechanics

### Points System

Clients earn points for completing key activities. This creates a tangible measure of effort and progress.

-   **Attend a Group Session:** +10 points
-   **Attend an Individual Session:** +15 points
-   **Attend a Verified Support Group (AA/NA):** +5 points
-   **Negative Drug Screen:** +20 points
-   **Complete a Program Phase (e.g., SROP Phase 1):** +50 points
-   **On-time Interlock Report Submission:** +10 points

### Badges & Achievements

Badges are visual rewards for reaching significant milestones. They are displayed in the client's portal and on the therapist's progress-tracking view.

-   **Phase 1 Complete:** Unlocked after finishing all Phase 1 requirements.
-   **50% Done:** Awarded at the halfway point of the SROP program.
-   **Consistent Attendance:** Awarded for attending 5 consecutive sessions without a miss.
-   **Perfect Attendance:** Awarded for 100% attendance in a calendar month.
-   **Compliance Champion:** Awarded for a month with no compliance issues (negative screens, on-time attendance).
-   **Program Graduate:** The final, most prestigious badge awarded upon successful program completion.

### Progress Bar

The primary visual mechanic. The SROP 75-hour tracker will be a multi-stage bar that fills up as clients complete hours. It will be color-coded to show progress within Phase 1 and Phase 2, providing immediate visual feedback.

### Implementation

-   Points and badges will be tracked automatically based on actions logged in the system (e.g., session check-ins, UA results).
-   Clients will receive pop-up alerts in their portal when they earn a new badge or a significant number of points.
-   Sharing of achievements is strictly optional and disabled by default to maintain privacy.

## 4. Therapist Gamification Mechanics

Gamification for therapists is designed to be professional and focused on performance metrics.

### Leaderboard (Optional & Internal)

A dashboard widget displaying anonymized or team-based KPIs.
-   **Highest Client Completion Rate (Quarterly)**
-   **Best Attendance Record (Caseload Average)**
-   **Highest DMH Compliance Score (Documentation Timeliness)**

### Badges

Recognize professional excellence and key contributions.
-   **Compliance Star:** Awarded for maintaining a 100% documentation compliance score for a month.
-   **Top Attender:** Awarded for managing the caseload with the highest average client attendance rate for a quarter.
-   **Mentorship Master:** Awarded for completing peer training or mentorship activities.

By implementing this strategy, we can create a more engaging and effective therapeutic environment for everyone involved.
