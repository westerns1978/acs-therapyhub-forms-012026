# ACS TherapyHub: Communication Guidelines

This document outlines the best practices for communication between staff, and between staff and clients, using the ACS TherapyHub platform and its integrated tools. Our goal is to ensure all communication is clear, timely, professional, and HIPAA-compliant.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Client-Centered & Empathetic:** All communication should be respectful and supportive, focusing on the client's progress and well-being.
2.  **Clear & Action-Oriented:** Avoid jargon. Make requests and provide information clearly. For example, instead of "Client issue," use "John Doe missed his 6/25 SROP group session."
3.  **Timely:** Aim to respond to all internal and client messages within 24 business hours.
4.  **Secure & HIPAA-Compliant:** **Never** share Protected Health Information (PHI) in non-secure channels. Use the TherapyHub messaging portal for all client-specific communication.

## Staff Communication (Internal)

### "Team Huddle" (Google Meet)

-   Use the "Instant Huddle" feature in the Communication Center for quick, ad-hoc case staffing.
-   Keep these calls focused and brief (10-15 mins).
-   Use this for complex clinical questions that are hard to resolve via text/chat.

### Slack Integration

Slack is our primary tool for real-time internal coordination.

-   **Channels:**
    -   `#acs-therapists`: General discussion, clinical questions, and peer support.
    -   `#client-updates`: **Automated notifications only.** This channel will receive alerts from TherapyHub regarding cancellations or positive drug screens.
-   **Best Practices:**
    -   Acknowledge alerts in `#client-updates` with an emoji (e.g., 👀 for seen, ✅ for handled).
    -   Move any discussion about an alert to a secure, private channel or a direct message.

## Client Communication (External)

### TherapyHub Secure Messaging Portal

This is the **only** approved channel for direct digital communication with clients regarding their treatment.

-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Sending appointment reminders.
    -   Answering non-urgent client questions.
    -   Providing guidance on program requirements.
    -   Sharing resources for support groups (AA/NA).
-   **Guidance for DMV/Interlock:**
    -   Use templated messages to provide clear, step-by-step instructions for submitting DMV forms.
    -   Proactively message clients 5-7 days before an ignition interlock report is due.

### Zoom Sessions

-   All telehealth appointments will be conducted via therapist-specific Zoom rooms linked in TherapyHub.
-   **Green Room Protocol:** Always enter the "Green Room" 2 minutes before a session to check your audio/video and review the client's last note/balance.
-   Verify the client's identity at the start of each session.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of care, ensure compliance, and operate as an efficient, coordinated team.
