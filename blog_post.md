# Regain Your License with Confidence: Introducing ACS TherapyHub

Navigating the path to license reinstatement after a DWI can feel overwhelming. The requirements are strict, the paperwork is complex, and staying on track with your SATOP or CSTAR program is crucial. At Assessment & Counseling Solutions, we understand these challenges. That's why we're proud to introduce **ACS TherapyHub**, a new platform designed to support you every step of the way.

### Your Journey, Simplified

ACS TherapyHub is more than just a tool; it's your personal co-pilot on the road to recovery and reinstatement. We've built it to empower you, provide clarity, and help you successfully complete your court-ordered program with confidence.

One of the most important parts of your journey is completing the required program hours, like the 75-hour SROP (SATOP Recidivism-Reduction Program). It can be hard to visualize where you are in the process. With ACS TherapyHub, you get a **clean, visual progress bar** that shows exactly how many hours you've completed and what's left to go. You can see your progress through each phase, turning a long journey into a series of achievable milestones.

### Stay Motivated and Informed

We believe in celebrating your hard work. Our new platform incorporates gamification, awarding you **badges and points** for consistent attendance and reaching key milestones. It’s a simple way to recognize your commitment and keep you motivated.

ACS TherapyHub also provides a central place for all your program-related needs:
-   **ASAM Assessments:** Our DMH-certified process, enhanced with AI summaries, helps create a treatment plan tailored to you.
-   **DMV & Interlock Guidance:** Get clear, timely reminders and track due dates for DMV paperwork and ignition interlock reports right from your portal.
-   **Secure Document Upload:** Easily upload necessary documents from home, knowing your information is kept safe and confidential.

### Our Commitment to You

At ACS, we have a long-standing commitment to serving our community, including specialized programs for women, children, and adolescents, all aligned with Missouri DMH standards. ACS TherapyHub is the next step in that commitment—using technology to make your path to reinstatement smoother and more successful.

Taking control of your future starts with the right tools and support. Let us guide you.
