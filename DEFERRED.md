# DEFERRED — post-demo hardening

Findings recorded during the Phase 0 appointment-layer recon (2026-06-24). These are
intentionally **not** being fixed this sprint. The 6/30 demo calendar is built on
`appointments.therapist_name` (text), which attributes the correct counselor on screen.
The items below are about moving from name-based to a structured, referentially-enforced
`therapist_id` link — real work that depends on auth/roles plumbing we are not touching now.

## 1. `user.id → counselors.id` gap (why id-attribution isn't wired)

The booking flows ([components/sessions/ScheduleSessionModal.tsx](components/sessions/ScheduleSessionModal.tsx),
[components/sessions/SessionWrapUpModal.tsx](components/sessions/SessionWrapUpModal.tsx)) resolve the
therapist from the logged-in session as a display **name** (`user?.name`, or the standing
group's `counselor_name`) and persist it to `appointments.therapist_name`. There is no path
to resolve the logged-in user to a `counselors` row: the `counselors` table (id, name,
zoom_link, zoom_meeting_id, active — 6 rows) has **no column linking it to an auth user**,
and there is no server-side role/identity mapping that ties a session to a counselor id.
Until counselors are linked to auth identities (or some deterministic name→id resolver is
introduced), the insert path cannot populate `appointments.therapist_id`, so attribution
stays text-based by necessity, not by preference.

## 2. Orphan rows blocking referential integrity

The structured id columns already exist but are effectively unused and partly dirty.
`appointments.therapist_id` (uuid) is set on only **11 of 215** rows, and **all 11** point
at no `counselors` row (orphans). `clients.assigned_therapist_id` (uuid) has **19** values
that likewise reference no counselor. These orphans are leftovers, not live attribution —
the app writes `therapist_name`, not these id columns. Before any FK can exist, the orphans
must be resolved: backfill from `therapist_name` where the name matches an active counselor,
and NULL out the remainder. That cleanup is a present-then-apply migration with the exact
`UPDATE` SQL shown for approval — deferred here, not yet written.

## 3. The FK that can't be added yet

The audit called for `FOREIGN KEY (therapist_id) REFERENCES counselors(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT`
on `appointments`, and the equivalent on `clients.assigned_therapist_id`. Neither constraint
can be created against the current data — Postgres will reject the `ADD CONSTRAINT` because of
the 11 + 19 orphan rows above. The FK is therefore gated on **two** prerequisites, in order:
(a) populate `therapist_id` going forward (requires item #1, the auth→counselor link), and
(b) clean the existing orphans (item #2). Once both are done, the FKs can be added as a
straightforward migration. For now `appointments.group_id → groups(id)` is the only FK on the
table, and the `service_type` CHECK (`counseling`/`education`/`rehabilitative_support`/`other`,
nullable) remains the appointment layer's only other DB-level guard.
